# TankPeripherals
Just a simple 1.8.9 mod that adds some methods to ComputerCraft computers that deal with tanks. Should properly handle just about any decently implemented tank that uses forge fluids (i.e. literally every tank you will ever use).  

Head over to the releases tab to grab the jar file, or build it yourself.
